    ## Schedule Handler:
        ## Characters are allotted X actions per hour
            ## Every tick (represetned as 60 tick in an hour) has a chance for an action to be done:
                ## If a character triggers an action, a pool is created for the character based on various conditions
                ## One option will be taken from the pool and displayed as an action.
